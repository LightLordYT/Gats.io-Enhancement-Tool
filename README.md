# IMPORTANT AWARENESS
some scripts unfortunately contain code that can take your personal information or data. Watch out for that.
I made this script since I thought the game started to become boring.
It was to kinda help self learn a bit more about js. DON'T COME COMPLAINING THERE IS A VIRUS IT IS OPENSOURCE.
This script does not contain any sort of virus or anything the code is available in entire.js(https://github.com/LightLordYT/Gats.io-Enhancement-Tool/blob/main/entire.js) anyway. Also the adblock isn't one hundred percent perfect...

# Installation
1. Download [tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) for chrome
2. Go to the tampermonkey dashboard and click Create a New Script
3. Copy the contents of the script from get.js
4. Delete all of the default script contents from tampermonkey
5. Paste the script into tampermonkey
6. Press Ctrl + s to save
7. Refresh gats.io and enjoy

# Updates Information 
When I push out new updates tampermonkey should detect it and ask if you want to update it. If not just look at github or greasyfork to see if there are new updates 
I will have version history available so you can see what I did for each new update. The big number 1.0.0 the one is the big number. ---\\
If the big number is changed that means that it is a really big update like new features or something. The first zero the one closest to one stands for medium updates
Medium updates are like adding one feature and fixing or improving a feature or something. The last zero the one farthest for the one is small updates.
Small updates are like fixing bugs and glitches here and there basically you won't notice a big difference if you use for example 1.0.1 and 1.0.0

# IMPORTANT FOR CUSTOMIZATION 
Look for the code function changeColor(and whatever color you want to have) for exmaple function changeColorBlue. If it has  // in front of it and you want the color then remove it. the reason that i have only made 3 available is that for some reason if i make more than that then it kinda malfunctions the script so.. just don't make it more than three colors
i have made it red green and blue for now but you can change it to whatever color you want as long as its within 3 colors in total also make so to do FILE--> SAVE
f you don't like the colors DON"T change the color name but just change the color value like for example #E8AA00 is color value go to here and pick a color: https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/
if you can help with the probelm stated above contact me:)

# How to start editing/hacking games yourself!
this does not require dev tools you can simply just go to the page and press ctrl+u or right click and press page source. There you can see the html and get some important and useful ids which you can change etc
also if you click on the .js and .css files you can see the css and js code. If you want to change the look go to css if you want to change like interaction such as "I think" aimbot and etc
call upon the ids/classes using document.getElementbyId or document.getElementByClassName. I recommend looking at khan academy for more info about it
